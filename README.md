# DBT Buddy
DBT Buddy is a full-stack web app for patients of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Instead of having to keep track of a paper diary card, patients can use DBT Buddy to track their moods, actions, and urges.  Users can log in and view their current week's entries, select a past week to view, make a diary entry, or edit an entry made earlier in the day. Users can opt in to tracking when they take their daily medications. They can also opt in to receiving reminders.

### Technologies
